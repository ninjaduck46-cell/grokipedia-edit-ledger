# Grokipedia Edit Ledger

**Public, immutable tracker of proposed vs. accepted edits to Grokipedia.**

> *Goal: Force transparency. Every omission, every delay, every rejection — logged in public.*

---

## How It Works

1. **Submit** a correction to Grokipedia via their form.
2. **Log it here** in the ledger (via Pull Request or Issue).
3. **We verify weekly** — check if it’s live on Grokipedia.
4. **Status updated**: `Pending` → `Accepted` / `Rejected` / `Partial`
