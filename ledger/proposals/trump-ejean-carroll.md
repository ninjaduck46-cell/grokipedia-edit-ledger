# Trump: E. Jean Carroll Case

**Suggested Addition (Legal Issues / Personal Life)**

> In May 2023, a New York federal jury found Trump civilly liable for sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s, awarding her $5 million in damages. The judge clarified the abuse met New York's legal definition of rape. In January 2024, a second jury awarded an additional $83.3 million for further defamation. Trump has appealed both rulings.
