# Biden: Hunter Biden Pardon (Context & Balance)

**Suggested Addition (Presidency → Family / Controversies)**

> On December 1, 2024, President Biden issued a full pardon for his son Hunter Biden on federal gun and tax charges. Biden stated the prosecution was “selective” and politically motivated. No evidence has linked Joe Biden to Hunter’s Burisma role (2014–2019) or business dealings, per Senate and House investigations.
