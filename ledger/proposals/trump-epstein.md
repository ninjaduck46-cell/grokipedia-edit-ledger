# Trump: Jeffrey Epstein Association

**Suggested Addition (Personal Life / Business Networks)**

> Trump and Epstein socialized in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump flew on Epstein’s plane at least 7 times (per unsealed flight logs) and called him a “terrific guy” in a 2002 *New York Magazine* interview. He banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago in 2004 and distanced himself after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. No charges were filed against Trump.
